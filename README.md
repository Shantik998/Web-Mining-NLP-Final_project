## Web-Mining-NLP-Final_project

# Description 
My final project in the Web Mining and Applied NLP course encompassed a comprehensive analysis of article content using a range of NLP techniques. I began by processing the text with the spaCy module, effectively parsing and tokenizing the data. Employing sentiment analysis, I uncovered underlying emotional tones, offering insights into the article's sentiment.

To identify core themes, I extracted the top five recurring words, shedding light on the dominant topics. Leveraging word cloud visualizations, I highlighted the most prominent terms, providing an immediate overview. Analyzing the distribution of common words within sentences added nuance to my exploration.

The project's culmination involved summarizing the article into a single sentence, achieved by selectively extracting significant sentences based on lemma scores. By combining data processing, sentiment analysis, keyword identification, visualization, and summarization, my project provided a comprehensive insight into the article's content and implications, demonstrating the practicality of NLP in web mining and analysis.
